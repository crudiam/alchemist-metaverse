# Welcome to Alchemist Metaverse


This is a project that I have started one day after joining the **Alchemist** community and Senior Alchemists were generous enough to give me 
a grand to keep building.


Just like Alchemist coin "the only plan is that there is no plan". I am currently building as something comes to my mind or see an opportunity.


## What can you do here?

* Listen Alchemist radio (iframe embedded soundcloud playlist)_visit [#alchemist-radio](https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/827687817416278016) channel for more info on the radio_
* Read FAQ
* View beautiful alchemist table (I have plans for this)
* Drag and Drop stuff :)

basically there is not too many features for now but we are getting there. 
Please write me a message if you have any cool ideas on what to do next (**crud#0293** on discord).

## Some ideas I had in mind:

* Have a full game-like experience (WASD for moving E for interacting with objects ...etc.)
* Add some window widgeds for further gamification
    * Quests (What you can do for alchemist)
    * Documentation (where you get information about alchemist coin)
    * Inventory (view your crucubles or maybe all of your NFT's)
* Extend the 3D area into a Room or to a Tavern, or maybe both?
* Interact with surrounding objects
* Chat with people who are also on the metaverse ðŸ¤”
* Full multiplayer type experience where you see others ðŸ¤¯
* Slay animals to get items ðŸ¤ª ok I went a little too far, but you get the point basically we can do anything we want...


### Additionally
